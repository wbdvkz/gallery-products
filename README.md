I used SolidJS and Tailwind

SolidJS because 
    - state-management is solved inside framework and very straightforword-simple
    - overall logic great
    - super fast 
    - lightweight

Tailwind because
    - very usefull for serious projects

I completed the Part 1 fully


--- For 1st bullet
    I mocked fetch function and showed fallback(Loading...)

    Loading takes 2 seconds

    Used all data from the data folder 

    Separated data into 2 JSONs inside db.js file
        allProductsTable
        oneProductDetailsTable


--- For 2 bullet
    I displayed skus as given in example 

    Made 2 item counts 4 and 6
        with appropriate buttons
            which are highlighted when hovered and chosen


--- For 3 bullet
    Added Gallery and List views 
        with appropriate buttons   
            which are highlighted when hovered and chosen

    Note Item count (4/6) also affects Gallery and List views 
        Its a feature


--- For 4 bullet
    Created right pannel as in the example

    Added 3 tabs
        Textiles
        Rules
        Suppkiers

    Tabs are highlighted when hovered and chosen

    Product images are shown

    Slider is present
        can slide automatically every 5 secs
        or can slide on click

    Added buttons
        Buttons give alerts


Overall, I completed all the tasks given 
Though must agree design could be better but as a first interaction with company looks OK

Part 2


I didn't understand the point of that 3D Universe hence for a great answer I might require short introduction from you


But talking about simply rebuilding that demo

I would use libraries like three.js
Though never used it 

I would dynamically create those points just as in normal non-3d coding

Rest seems straightforward 
    showing similar textiles 
        once clicked filter out different or find similar
    
    Add/remove points 
        once clicked add or delete from cache or db

    Adjust number 
        similar as Add/remove
